# A TRIANGLE Enables Multimodal Alignment Beyond Cosine Similarity

## Plots for Reviewer AUzo

### Plot 1.
![TRIANGLE vs pairwise cosine loss](losses.png)

Losses for TRIANGLE and for the conventional pairwise cosine similarity method. TRIANGLE achieves better convergence.

### Plot 2&3.
![Area value plot](area.jpg)

Area value among true matching triplets (text-audio-video) plot during training from scratch on MSR-VTT dataset. The value decreases during training, meaning the area is minimized.

![R@1 plot](r1.jpg)

Corresponding R@1 score to the plotted area value above during training.
